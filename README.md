The purpose of this script is to analyze district wide standardized test results. 

###Datasets
Two datasets were used in this analysis: general information about the district high schools and individual student performance on standardized testing.

As can be seen from the tables below, charter schools have the highest average test scores while district schools have the lowest.

It is also clear that in this district schools that have higher budgets/per student and fewer students have higher performing students.

Much of the research on standardized testing performance supports these findings. 

Instructions
----------------
This script is tailored to two datasets with specific column names and information. If it were to be applied to another dataset, the data would need to be formatted accordingly or the code would need to be modified.
